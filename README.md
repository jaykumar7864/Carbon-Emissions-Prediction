# Carbon-Emissions-Prediction
Carbon emissions prediction involves forecasting greenhouse gas emissions to inform decision-making and reduce climate change impacts. It uses data and machine learning to predict emissions trends, enabling proactive measures for sustainability.

# Description of The Project:
Business Objective of the project

The primary objective of the project is to develop a model that can accurately predict CO2 emissions based on different engine features of cars.

The goal is to estimate the amount of CO2 a car will emit using the provided data.

# Tools and Technologies:
The project was developed using various tools and technologies, including:

Python programming language

Libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, scikit-learn, and Streamlit

Linear Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models for prediction

Deployment on the cloud using Streamlit
